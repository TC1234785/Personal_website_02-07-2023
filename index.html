          <p>
            My name is <b>Tobias Chau</b>. I'm currently studying CIT and
            related information for the first time at BCIT. I
            <em>really like</em> cute things, whether they be animals, food, or
            anything else. Let me know if there is anything I should do!

          <p> It's currently halfway through the term when I am writing this paragraph. So far, I don't feel too bad about my results, but I can't let that get to me. It's <em>pivotal</em> that I stay on task and focused for the remaining months to go. If any other students in 1620 see this, I hope you're doing well too!</p>
