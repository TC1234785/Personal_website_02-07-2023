              My name is <b>Tobias Chau</b>. I'm currently studying CIT and
              related information for the first time at BCIT. I
              <em>really like</em> cute things, whether they be animals, food,
              or anything else. Let me know if there is anything I should do!
            </p>

          <img
        src="images/Cat_sleeping.jfif"
        alt="Sleeping Cat"
        width="700"

      />

            <p>
              It's currently halfway through the term when I am writing this
              paragraph. So far, I don't feel too bad about my results, but I
              can't let that get to me. It's <em>pivotal</em> that I stay on
              task and focused for the remaining months to go. If any other
              students in 1620 see this, I hope you're doing well too!
